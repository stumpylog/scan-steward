scan-steward is a tool to help you sort, categorize, and generally assist with making sense of a bunch of old images.s

## Inspiration

This project was born out of another project I embarked on in late 2023, the scanning of thousands of slides from my
parents' and grandparents' trips and life. As I accumulated more and more images, with pictures of my family, as well
as pictures of other things, I found it hard to keep track of what images a particular person showed up in. Then I
wanted to know where the picture was taken, roughly what it was about, an idea of the year and finally to know any
important memories attached to the image.

Existing photo album type software didn't have the features I wanted. Captions were too basic, searching didn't allow
combinations of people and location or required highly specific location and time information. And so, this project was
born with the goal to assist one or more family members in sorting out all that information.

It allows one or more users (probably other family members) to view, sort, categorize, tag and add memories scans of old photographs,
slides, etc and then share with more users to view, remember and enjoy a little bit of history no one might have ever seen before.

## Features

- Tag one or more people who appear in photographs and filter by only images including those people
- Tag multiple locations, letting you go from general ("Georgia") to specific ("Atlanta") to really specific ("Coke Headquarters")
  and then find other photographs in same location
- Create trips, with attached descriptions of where the trip went and when it happened and any memories of the trip
- Attach memories to a trip or photograph, ranging from just text descriptions, to voice files or postcards or diary entires, to help
  record the experiences the trip brought to everyone
- Mark exact duplicates so you don't need to keep seeing the same image again and again
- Mark similar shots and choose the best one to display to the family
